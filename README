=====
SYNOPSIS:

MPS <input_file_name> <output_file_name>

This program supports solving maximum planar subset methods.
=====
DIRECTORY:

bin/	  executable binary
doc/	  reports
inputs/   input data (all chords)
outputs/  output result (maximum planar subset chords)
lib/	  library
src/ 	  source C++ codes
utility/  checker
======
HOW TO CIMPILE:

Then compile the demo, simply follow the following steps
	make
======
HOW TO RUN:

	cd bin/
	./bin/MPS <input_file_name> <output_file_name>
	For example,
	under b06611037_pa1
	./bin/MPS inputs/100000.in outputs/100000.out
======
HOW TO VERIFY RESULT

    cd utility/
    ./PA1_Result_Checker <result_file_name>
	For example,
	under <student_id>_pa1
	./utility/PA1_Result_Checker ./output/5.case1.out
